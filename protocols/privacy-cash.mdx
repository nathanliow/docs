Privacy Cash is a privacy protocol on Solana that enables confidential transactions using zero-knowledge proofs. Users can shield and withdraw SOL and USDC while maintaining transaction privacy, ensuring that transaction amounts and participants remain private.

## Overview

Privacy Cash implements a privacy protocol on Solana that allows users to:

- **Shield SOL**: Deposit SOL into a privacy pool, generating a commitment that is added to a Merkle tree
- **Withdraw SOL**: Withdraw SOL from the privacy pool to any recipient address using zero-knowledge proofs
- **Shield USDC**: Deposit USDC into a privacy pool
- **Withdraw USDC**: Withdraw USDC from the privacy pool to any recipient address
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that withdrawals cannot be linked to deposits, providing privacy for Solana transactions

## APIs

### Transactions

APIs for privacy transactions:

#### SOL Operations
- **deposit()**: Deposit SOL into privacy pools (shield)
- **withdraw()**: Withdraw SOL from privacy pools to recipient address (unshield)
- **getPrivateBalance()**: Get private SOL balance in privacy pools

#### USDC Operations
- **depositUSDC()**: Deposit USDC into privacy pools (shield)
- **withdrawUSDC()**: Withdraw USDC from privacy pools to recipient address (unshield)
- **getPrivateBalanceUSDC()**: Get private USDC balance in privacy pools

## SDKs & Clients

### JavaScript/TypeScript

**Package**: `privacycash`

**Installation**:
```bash
npm install privacycash
```

**Usage**:
```javascript
import { PrivacyCash } from 'privacycash';

async function main() {
  let client = new PrivacyCash({
    RPC_url: '[YOUR_SOLANA_MAINNET_RPC_URL]',
    owner: '[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]'
  });

  // Historical UTXOs will be cached locally for faster performance.
  // You don't need to call clearCache() unless you encountered some issues and want to do a full refresh.
  // client.clearCache()

  // Deposit SOL
  let depositRes = await client.deposit({
    lamports: 0.02 * 1_000_000_000
  });
  console.log(depositRes);

  let balance = await client.getPrivateBalance();
  console.log('balance after deposit:', balance, balance.lamports / 1_000_000_000);

  // Withdraw SOL
  let withdrawRes = await client.withdraw({
    lamports: 0.01 * 1_000_000_000,
    recipientAddress: '[RECIPIENT_ADDRESS]'
  });
  console.log(withdrawRes);

  balance = await client.getPrivateBalance();
  console.log('balance after withdraw:', balance, balance.lamports / 1_000_000_000);

  // Get USDC balance
  let usdcBalance = await client.getPrivateBalanceUSDC();
  console.log('USDC balance:', usdcBalance, usdcBalance.base_units / 1e6);

  // Deposit USDC
  let depositUSDCRes = await client.depositUSDC({
    base_units: 2 * 1e6
  });
  console.log(depositUSDCRes);

  // Withdraw USDC
  let withdrawUSDCRes = await client.withdrawUSDC({
    base_units: 2 * 1e6,
    recipientAddress: '[RECIPIENT_ADDRESS]'
  });
  console.log(withdrawUSDCRes);
}

main();
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install the SDK**: `npm install privacycash`
2. **Check the example project** in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Privacy-Cash/privacy-cash-sdk) under `/example` folder
3. **Use Node version 24 or above**
4. **Start building** privacy-preserving applications

<Note>
Historical UTXOs are cached locally for faster performance. You don't need to call `clearCache()` unless you encounter issues and want to do a full refresh.
