Triton is a high-performance Solana infrastructure provider focused on ultra-reliable RPC, block production connectivity, and high-throughput transaction bandwidth.

## Overview

Triton provides:

- High-throughput Solana RPC endpoints
- Low-latency access to Solana validators and block engines
- Turnkey access to common Solana APIs (Jupiter, Metaplex, etc.) via a single endpoint
- Advanced routing and global infrastructure for resilient dApps

## APIs

### Tokens

APIs and routes for token data via Triton-backed RPC and partner integrations:

- Standard Solana token RPC (via `getTokenAccountsByOwner`, `getAccountInfo`, etc.)
- Token metadata and balances through downstream providers configured on Triton

### Transactions

APIs for sending and inspecting transactions:

- `sendTransaction` via Triton RPC endpoints
- `getTransaction` and `getBlock` for transaction and block inspection
- High-throughput submission paths for latency-sensitive flows

### Webhooks

Triton commonly integrates with external webhook services and indexers; typical patterns include:

- Transaction status notifications
- Account change notifications
- Program event notifications

### Streaming

Triton can be used with Solana WebSocket subscriptions for streaming:

- Account change subscriptions
- Program logs and events
- Slot and block notifications

## Triton-specific capabilities

- Optimized routing to Solana validators
- Support for MEV / block-engine style integrations
- Stake-weighted or priority transaction bandwidth via Triton partners

## SDKs & Clients

Triton is typically consumed via standard Solana clients pointed at Triton endpoints.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

Use `@solana/web3.js` with a Triton RPC URL:

```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js
```

```ts
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';

const connection = new Connection('https://rpc.triton.one/YOUR_KEY');
// Use standard Solana RPC methods against Triton infrastructure
```

### Python

Use `solana-py` with a Triton endpoint:

```bash
pip install solana
```

```python
from solana.rpc.api import Client

client = Client('https://rpc.triton.one/YOUR_KEY')
# Use standard Solana RPC methods against Triton
```

### REST / WebSocket

- **REST/RPC**: Use your Triton HTTPS endpoint for JSON-RPC
- **WebSocket**: Use the corresponding `wss://` endpoint for subscriptions

## Getting Started

1. Contact Triton or sign up via their site for access
2. Obtain your Triton RPC endpoint and credentials
3. Point your Solana client (web3.js, solana-py, etc.) at the Triton URL
4. Start sending traffic through Triton for higher reliability and performance
